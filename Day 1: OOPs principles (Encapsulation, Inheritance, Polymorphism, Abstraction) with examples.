Encapsulation → Hiding fields(making them private), exposing via getters/setters.

Inheritance → One class deriving from another(parent(superclass) and child(subclass) class).

Polymorphism → Method overloading(compile time polymorphism static binding) & overriding(runtime polymorphism dynamic binding).

Abstraction → Hiding implementation details, showing only functionality(like ATM).
